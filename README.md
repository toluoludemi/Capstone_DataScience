# Capstone Data Science Project

The goal of my project was to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.

**The models trained were:**
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Random Forest

- **Notebook #1 - Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**
In this notebook, I loaded the raw dataset from the source, conducted data cleaning where applicable, and dived into exploratory data analysis to obtain insights from the data prior to preprocessing and modelling.

- **Notebook #2 - Preprocessing**
In this notebook, I loaded the cleaned up and feature engineered dataset from Notebook #1, and transformed it to be model ready. This includes transforming categorical columns to numeric columns.

- **Notebook #3 - Modelling**
In this notebook, I loaded the preprocessed, model ready dataset and fitted it on the models mentioned above. I then optimized the best performing base models to get even better model performance.

- **Tableau File** - contains visuals created for the project.
