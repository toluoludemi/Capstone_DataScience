Tolulope_Oludemi - README File.

Contents of the Submission:
- Business Report
- Tableau File containing visuals created for the project
- Three (3) Jupyter Notebooks

The three Jupyter Notebooks contain the following:

1. Tolulope_Oludemi - Notebook #1 - Cleaning and EDA:
In this notebook, I loaded the raw dataset from the source, conducted data cleaning where applicable, and dived into exploratory data analysis to obtain insights from the data prior to preprocessing and modeling.

2. Tolulope_Oludemi - Notebook #2 - Preprocessing:
In this notebook, I will be loaded the cleaned up and feature engineered dataset (cleaned_cc_trans_df.csv) and processed it to be model ready. This includes transforming categorical columns to numeric columns.

3. Tolulope_Oludemi - Notebook #3 - Modeling:
In this notebook, I loaded the pre-processed, model ready dataset and fitted it on the following models:
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

The goal of this notebook was to identify the best performing model. The chosen model was then optimized to see if an even better performance can be observed.
